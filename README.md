# SOLID principles
### Single responsibility
A class should have only a single responsibility.

### Open/closed principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Liskov substitution principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

### Interface segregation principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
